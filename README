CSCE 625 - Artificial Intelligence
Project 2

There are three ways to run this project. Both out of place and the new heuristic will be run to show comparison.

1. The source files are given in the folder CSCE625Project2/src. These files can be compiled and the astar/BlocksWorldRandomGenerator.class should be run.
	Akshays-MacBook-Pro:bin akshaykulkarni$ java -cp . astar/BlocksWorldRandomGenerator 5 3
	Argument 1: Number of blocks
	Argument 2: Number of stacks

2. The class files are given in the folder CSCE625Project1/bin. The navigators/Navigator.class should be run.
	Akshays-MacBook-Pro:bin akshaykulkarni$ java -cp . astar/BlocksWorldRandomGenerator 5 3
	Argument 1: Number of blocks
	Argument 2: Number of stacks

3. The Eclipse project is given in the zip file called CSCE625Project2.zip, this project should be imported into Eclipse and the BlocksWorldRandomGenerator class in the astar package should be run.

Recommended method is point 2.
